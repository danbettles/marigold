Marigold is a small set of tools that aims to make building simple websites easier while keeping you close to the metal and adding minimal overheads; it is not a framework.

Marigold is good for:
* Building minimal apps like [Miniblog](https://github.com/miniblog/engine).
* Transitioning unstructured code to a framework, or simply making improvements to an unruly app.
* Building basic websites using templates like those at [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
* Extending WordPress.
